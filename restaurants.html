    <h4>Here are my favorite restaurants in order of how much I like them</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Voodoo Donuts</li>
        <li>Big Burger</li>
        <li>Auntie Annes</li>
        <li>Happy Family</li>
        <li><a href="kitchen.html">My Kitchen</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Many of these places hold valuable <em>memories</em> from my childhood. I grew up in a small town called <b>Molalla</b> outside of Portland. 
        I have fond memores of eating <em>maple bacon donuts</em> and other fancy donuts from Voodoo. <b>Big Burger</b> has the best milkshakes in the city.
        I miss eating at some of these places that only exist in Portland.
